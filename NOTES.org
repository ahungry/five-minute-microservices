* General thoughts and notes

For most of these, they are all equivalent or very similar - either
they ship/build in a web server, and at that point run on an async
event loop (node) or do heavy thread spawning in a sync fashion.

Using CGI (any other than FastCGI) ends up being slow, but ensures an
isolated process per request, which could be nice.

Using CGI/FastCGI (wrap or lib) could actually allow for pushing the
routing layer to the web server (nginx) instead of having to bake it
into the app.

What could be interesting in an approach like this would be setting up
a system that runs each libfcgi via spawn-fcgi on a different socket
or port entirely, for dispatching by nginx.
